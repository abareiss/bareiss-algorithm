# bareiss-algorithm
A Python implementation of the Bareiss Algorithm, created by Erwin Bareiss, my grandfather, which he wrote about in his paper titled "Sylvester's Identity and Multistep Integer- Preserving Gaussian Elimination." 

The algorithm calculates the determinant of a square matrix (integer entries) requiring only integer arithmetic, eleminating round-off errors that can occur with Gaussian elimination.
